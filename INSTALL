To install it, make sure you have Python 2.3 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install to install package
    python setup.py bdist_egg to build egg package
    python setup.py bdist_rpm to build rpm package

Note this requires a working Internet connection if you don't already have the
Python utility "setuptools" installed.
